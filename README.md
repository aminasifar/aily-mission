# Machine Failure & Maintenance Agent 
### The Business problem
You work for a large manufacturing or industrial operation with multiple machines operating continuously.
Unexpected machine failures are causing costly downtime, disrupting production schedules and increasing operational expenses.
The **key challenges** includes:
* Unplanned downtime impacts output and revenue.
* **Failures can cascade**, affecting other machines.
* Maintenance teams react to failures rather than prevent them, limiting **efficiency**.
Nowadays, maintenance decisions are often reactive, replaying on periodic checks and technician experience. Senior data exists, but it is underutilized.
What's out mission? Transfform operations with predective intelligence.

### What’s your mission? 
Design an AI agent that helps maintenance technicians predict failures, detect 
anomalies, and recommend precise maintenance actions to reduce downtime 
and optimize operations.
